	<div id="f_para">I am Pradeep Mondal, a learning developer in everything you could imagine. My interest lies currently in web and software development but this doesn't mean you couldn't find me in other things. Lately, I started to participate in many other things.

	<P id="s_para">I am a big lover of edm music and specially those with some melody. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Walker_(music_producer)" target="_blank" id="Alan">Alan Walker</a> is a great inspiration for me. His songs cure almost every pain inside me and has been a constant source of motivation to do something with this life.

	<P id="t_para">Coding, Developing and Music is not only my passion but my life.
